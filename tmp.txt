Proton configurations in the hydrogen bonds of KH2PO4 as seen by resonant x-ray diffraction.
KH2PO4 (KDP) belongs to the class of hydrogen-bonded ferroelectrics, whose paraelectric to
ferroelectric phase transition is driven by the ordering of the protons in the hydrogen bonds. We
demonstrate that forbidden reflections of KDP, when measured at an x-ray absorption edge, are
highly sensitive to the asymmetry of proton configurations. The change of average symmetry caused
by the ’freezing’ of the protons during the phase transition is clearly evidenced. In the paraelectric
phase, we identify in the resonant spectra of the forbidden reflections a contribution related to the
transient proton configurations in the hydrogen bonds, which violates the high average symmetry
of the sites of the resonant atoms. The analysis of the temperature dependence reveals a change of
relative probabilities of the different proton configurations. They follow the Arrhenius law and the
activation energies of polar and Slater configurations are 18.6 and 7.3 meV respectively.
